<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">bocfel</code> is a Z-machine interpreter. It
    fully supports versions 1-5, 7, and 8 of the Z-machine, with extremely
    limited support for version 6. It can read stories stored in Blorb files,
    but has no support for associated graphics, if any exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl">-a</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">eval_stack_size</var></dt>
  <dd>The Z-machine contains an evaluation stack which games use as a sort of
      scratch space when performing calculations. By default the size of this
      stack is set at 16384, which should be sufficient for any game. The entire
      stack is allocated at once, so if you are on a system with a small amount
      of memory, setting this to a smaller value will cause less memory to be
      allocated.
    <p class="Pp">The maximum value is limited only by system memory. Each
        evaluation stack entry takes two bytes. If you ever encounter a
        &#x201C;stack overflow&#x201D; message with the default size, please let
        me know.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><code class="Fl">-A</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">call_stack_size</var></dt>
  <dd>The Z-machine allows games to call routines in order to get work done;
      these routines can call other routines, and so on. Information about these
      routines is placed onto the call stack, which by default has a size of
      1024. This means that no more than 1024 routines can be active at any
      single time. This value should be much more than sufficient for any game.
      As with the evaluation stack, memory for the call stack is allocated at
      one time, so machines with small amounts of memory can reduce this value
      to reduce memory consumption.
    <p class="Pp">The maximum value allowable by the Z-machine is 65535. Each
        call stack entry takes between 40 and 50 bytes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl">-c</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If the Glk implementation being used is Gargoyle, or if Glk is not being
      used at all, support for colors is provided. This option disables color
      support entirely.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><code class="Fl">-C</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not read the configuration file. Settings in the configuration file
      take precedence over those specified on the command line, so if you want
      to override the configuration file, use this option.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Many Glk implementations allow timed input as used by games such as
      <a class="permalink" href="#Border"><i class="Em" id="Border">Border
      Zone</i></a>. This option disables timed input and informs games that
      timed input is not available.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><code class="Fl">-D</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If Gargoyle is being used, sound effects are supported. This option
      disables sound effects and informs games that sound effects are not
      available.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><code class="Fl">-e</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on ANSI escapes in the transcript. If this option is enabled, all
      user input in the transcript can be decorated with ANSI escape sequences
      so it stands out. See the <code class="Fl">-E</code> option.</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><code class="Fl">-E</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">escape_string</var></dt>
  <dd>If the <code class="Fl">-e</code> option is used, this sets the escape
      string that will be used when highlighting user input in the transcript.
      ^[[ is written, then <var class="Ar">escape_string</var>, then ^[[0m. By
      default &#x201C;1m&#x201D; is used as the escape string, providing bold
      text.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Many Glk implementations allow a fixed-width font to be selected. This
      option disables fixed-width fonts and informs games that fixed-width fonts
      are not available. The game might still be displayed using a fixed-width
      font (e.g. if you are playing in a terminal), but the game has no way of
      knowing this.</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F"><code class="Fl">-F</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Glk does not allow the mixing of text styles, so it is not possible to
      request, for example, both fixed-width and reverse video. If both styles
      are requested, fixed-width takes precedence. However, if
      <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> is being run in a terminal (with, for
      example, the glktermw Glk implementation), the font will be fixed at all
      times. The <code class="Fl">-F</code> flag tells
      <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> to assume that the current font is always
      fixed, allowing other styles to be applied simultaneously. See the puzzle
      pieces in Graham Nelson's
      <a class="permalink" href="#Jigsaw"><i class="Em" id="Jigsaw">Jigsaw</i></a>
      for an example of how this can be useful.
    <p class="Pp">See also the <a class="Sx" href="#STYLES">STYLES</a> section.
        Note that Gargoyle does allow the mixing of styles, so this option does
        nothing under Gargoyle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><code class="Fl">-g</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable the character graphics font. See the
      <a class="Sx" href="#CHARACTER_GRAPHICS_FONT">CHARACTER GRAPHICS FONT</a>
      section below.</dd>
  <dt id="G"><a class="permalink" href="#G"><code class="Fl">-G</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Select an alternative style of box drawing characters.
    <p class="Pp">Most characters in the graphics font map fairly well to
        Unicode equivalents, but a few box drawing characters do not. Two
        methods for drawing the missing characters are provided, each with pros
        and cons. A description of the differences is not sufficient, so it is
        recommended that you try <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> both with and
        without this option, paying attention to the map connections. See also
        the <a class="Sx" href="#CHARACTER_GRAPHICS_FONT">CHARACTER GRAPHICS
        FONT</a> section below.</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>Display a short help message then exit.</dd>
  <dt id="H"><a class="permalink" href="#H"><code class="Fl">-H</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable save history playback. When saving, <code class="Nm">bocfel</code>
      includes a snapshot of the screen state (more or less) in order to play it
      back on restore to provide context as to what was happening before the
      game was saved. This flag disables playback of history. Note that history
      will still be stored on save even when this option is selected; it just
      won't be played back on restore.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl">-i</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Print out the ID of the specified game and exit. This ID is used to
      uniquely identify a game and is adapted from the Treaty of Babel standard.
      Game IDs can be used in the configuration file to set options for specific
      games. See the <a class="Sx" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
      FILE</a> section for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><code class="Fl">-k</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The Z-machine has a concept of &#x201C;terminating keys&#x201D;. When
      enabled, these keys, in addition to Enter, terminate input immedately.
      <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i>, for example, uses this so that F1
      automatically executes &#x201C;look around&#x201D;, F2 does
      &#x201C;inventory&#x201D;, and so on. However, <i class="Em">Beyond
      Zork</i> also claims the up arrow, which means that history browsing, in
      Glk implementations that support it, might not be able to be initiated
      with the up arrow. This option disables the use of terminating keys. Note
      that not all Glk implementations support terminating keys.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">username</var></dt>
  <dd>Set the username by writing up to 8 bytes to the location
      <a class="permalink" href="#0x38"><b class="Sy" id="0x38">0x38</b></a> in
      the story file. This is not officially part of the Z-machine, but is at
      least used by
      <a class="permalink" href="#Hollywood"><i class="Em" id="Hollywood">Hollywood
      Hijinx</i></a>, where a username starting with either &#x201C;DA&#x201D;
      or &#x201C;TOMAS&#x201D; enables the debugging command &#x201C;flush
      33&#x201D; which moves you to a junction room which leads to various other
      locations, allowing puzzles to be bypassed.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><code class="Fl">-m</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Disable meta commands. See <a class="Sx" href="#META_COMMANDS">META
      COMMANDS</a> below for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">number</var></dt>
  <dd>Z-machine interpreters are able to inform games what platform they are
      running on by setting an interpreter number in the range 1 to 11. The
      following are the valid values (taken from Graham Nelson's
      <i class="Em">Z-Machine Standards Document</i> 1.1):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <ol class="Bl-enum Bd-indent Bl-compact">
      <li>DECSystem-20</li>
      <li>Apple IIe</li>
      <li>Macintosh</li>
      <li>Amiga</li>
      <li>Atari ST</li>
      <li>IBM PC</li>
      <li>Commodore 128</li>

      <li>Apple IIc</li>
      <li>Apple IIgs</li>
      <li>Tandy Color</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Pp" id="Trinity">By and large this value is meaningless. Some
        Infocom games do make small use of this information:
        <a class="permalink" href="#Trinity"><i class="Em">Trinity</i></a>, for
        example, has a &#x201C;print emphasized&#x201D; routine that is used to
        print emphasized (which generally means italicized) text; on any machine
        but the Atari, however, this routine makes sure not to print punctuation
        in italics. <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> makes what is probably the
        most visible use of the interpreter number, using it to decide how to
        deal with character graphics. See section 16 of the
        <i class="Em">Z-Machine Standards Document</i> 1.1 for more information.
        By default, the interpreter version is set to 1 becuase this causes
        <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> to prompt the user about the machine he is
        using, allowing him to select whether or not character graphics are
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">I do not recommend setting this to 11. At least
        <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> assumes that the largest it will be is 10,
        and setting it to 11 can cause an out-of-bounds memory access. The
        instance I have seen of this is not fatal, but there may be other
        instances that are.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><code class="Fl">-N</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">version</var></dt>
  <dd>Even more meaningless than the interpreter number is the interpreter
      version. This, as far as has been determined, is never used except when
      the user asks a game to either report its version or to verify its disk
      image. In these cases, the version is simply printed out, nothing more.
      This is a single character and there is no real reason to change it. The
      default is C.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a></dt>
  <dd><code class="Nm">bocfel</code> includes patches to work around some known
      bugs in games. This flag disables such patches.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><code class="Fl">-r</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Play back a command record (see <code class="Fl">-s</code>) as soon as the
      game begins. Some games provide a way to play back a record (typically
      through the REPLAY verb in Inform-based games, and #comm in some Infocom
      games), but this option is useful to start playback before you have an
      opportunity to call REPLAY, or if the game provides no way to play back
      such a record.
    <p class="Pp">Command records must be UTF-8.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also the <a class="Sx" href="#META_COMMANDS">META

  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on command recording. This records every keystroke the player makes,
      and (hopefully) creates a record that is suitable for playback either by
      using <code class="Fl">-r</code> or through a game command. Some games
      provide this functionality themselves (typically through the RECORDING
      verb in Inform-based games, and #reco in some Infocom games), but this
      option is useful to start recording before you have an opportunity to call
      RECORDING, or if the game provides no way to start such a record.

  <dd>Turn on transcripting. This records both the output of the game and user
      input. If the chosen transcript file exists, it will be appended to, not
      overwritten. This way you can easily continue a transcript every time you
      come back to a game.

    <var class="Ar">slots</var></dt>
  <dd>Some games provide the ability to undo a turn. In fact, some games allow
      multiple turns to be undone. This option controls how many save slots are
      available. Unlike the stacks (see <code class="Fl">-a</code> and
      <code class="Fl">-A</code>), save slots are dynamic, meaning that unless a
      game provides support for undo, no memory will be used. However, games
      that do support undo will typically take a snapshot each turn, causing
      memory to be allocated. The size of each snapshot depends on the game and
      the current state of play. Memory usage is minimized as much as possible:
      at the beginning of <i class="Em">Anchorhead</i>, for example, each slot
      takes up roughly 900 bytes. As the game progresses, though, the size of a
      save slot inevitably will increase: near the end of
      <i class="Em">Anchorhead</i>, my save slots were taking up roughly 4500
      bytes.
    <p class="Pp" id="Sherlock">Note that Inform-based games (at least by
        default) do not support multiple undo; two non-V6 Infocom games, to my
        knowledge, do:
        <a class="permalink" href="#Sherlock"><i class="Em">Sherlock</i></a> and
        <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i>. However, <code class="Nm">bocfel</code>
        includes the ability to perform multiple undo regardless of whether the
        game provides support for it. See the
        <a class="Sx" href="#META_COMMANDS">META COMMANDS</a> section for more
        information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value is 100. A value of zero disables undo.</p>

  <dd>Many games include abbreviations for commonly-used commands: x for
      EXAMINE, g for AGAIN, z for WAIT, and o for OOPS. Some early Infocom
      games, however, do not provide these. For these Infocom games, x, g, z,
      and o are mapped to their respective commands, providing convenient
      shortcuts for games that don't provide them. If a game requires one of
      these letters for its own use, these abbreviations can be turned off with
      <code class="Fl">-x</code>.</dd>
  <dt id="X"><a class="permalink" href="#X"><code class="Fl">-X</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Enable the Tandy, or censorship flag. This flag is generally unused, but
      it does change some language in <i class="Em">The Witness</i> which was,
      apparently, offensive to the Tandy Corporation. Some other games add a
      note regarding licensing to Tandy, but apart from this, it is apparently
      unused by Infocom.</dd>
  <dt id="y"><a class="permalink" href="#y"><code class="Fl">-y</code></a></dt>
  <dd>When transcripting is turned on and an existing file is selected, that
      file is appended to rather than overwritten. This option causes the file
      to be overwritten.</dd>
  <dt id="Y"><a class="permalink" href="#Y"><code class="Fl">-Y</code></a></dt>
  <dd>In almost all games, either the game's UNDO command or the
      <b class="Sy">/undo</b> meta command will work. However, if you encounter
      a game where undo appears broken, try using this option. It will instruct
      <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> to ignore the game's undo code, instead
      using only its own undo handling. This might work if the game's undo
      handling is subpar, either by design or by accident. Note that if this
      option is active, <b class="Sy">/undo</b> must be used instead of the
      game's UNDO command.</dd>

  <dd>Provide a seed to the pseudo-random number generator, causing it to yield
      predictable values. This option is probably only of use to game authors
      who are doing testing. The generator will be reseeded with this value
      whenever the @random opcode is called with a 0 operand or when the
      @restart opcode is called. The <code class="Fl">-Z</code> option overrides
      this option.</dd>
  <dt id="Z"><a class="permalink" href="#Z"><code class="Fl">-Z</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">device</var></dt>
  <dd>Provide a device from which random numbers are read for the @random
      opcode. This is meant to be used with special files such as
      <span class="Pa">/dev/urandom</span>, although it can be used with any
      file. If a read error occurs or end-of-file is reached,
      <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> will switch to using a pseudo-random number
      generator. If the game is put into predictable mode via a negative operand
      to @random, a pseudo-random number generator will be used until the game
      switchs back to random mode.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The parenthesized character describes the type of argument: b is a
    boolean (1 is true, 0 is false), c is a character, n is a number, and s is a
    string. These all correspond to possible command-line arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to analogs to the command-line arguments, there are a
    few other options that can be set through the configuration file:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li>Cheating: see the <a class="Sx" href="#CHEATING">CHEATING</a> section
      below.</li>
  <li>Autosaving: when autosaving is enabled, <code class="Nm">bocfel</code>
      will perform a save each time input is read, silently storing the save
      file to a persistent location on disk. On startup, if that file exists and
      is a valid save file, it will be loaded. This allows players to continue
      from where they left off without needing to explicitly save. If the user
      explicitly quits the game (usually via the QUIT command, but in fact any
      time the @quit opcode is called), the autosave file will be removed,
      allowing the game to start from the beginning next time.
    <p class="Pp">Autosaving is not perfect: history is saved and replayed, but
        only in the lower window. The contents of the upper window, if it is
        being used, are not saved. That means that if the upper window is in
        use, it will likely look incorrect after autorestore, because the game
        will not know it needs to redraw it. This might be something that's
        quickly corrected by the game (e.g. if it redraws the upper window each
        turn), but it might not be.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To enable this feature, set the &#x201C;autosave&#x201D;
        option, in the configuration file, to true (1). By default, autosaving
        is disabled. At the moment, this feature is available only on Unix and
        Windows. The location of autosave directory is
        <span class="Pa">$XDG_DATA_HOME/bocfel/autosave</span> on Unix and
        <span class="Pa">%APPDATA%\bocfel\autosave</span> on Windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Persistent transcripts: if enabled, <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> will
      automatically keep a transcript of the entire game session, irrespective
      of whether &#x201C;official&#x201D; transcripting provided by the
      Z-machine is turned on. This transcript can be saved to a file with the
      <b class="Sy">/savetranscript</b> meta command (see the
      <a class="Sx" href="#META_COMMANDS">META COMMANDS</a> section below). In
      addition, the transcript will be stored in save files, including, if
      enabled, autosave files. This means that transcripts will persist across
      sessions, so you will have the full transcript without having to remember
      to turn it on, or where you stored it.
    <p class="Pp">To enable this feature, set the
        &#x201C;persistent_transcript&#x201D; option, in the configuration file,
        to true (1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Text editor: <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> allows the user to take notes
      in an external text editor and will include the notes in save files to
      allow notes to be associated with a particular gaming session across saves
      and restores. In addition, the configuration file can be edited via a text
      editor launched by <code class="Nm">bocfel</code>. On Windows and macOS,
      the system text editor is used. On other Unix platforms, a default list of
      GUI text editors is tried. If you want to set a specific text editor, the
      &#x201C;editor&#x201D; configuration entry can be set to whichever editor
      you would like. This is either an absolute path to an editor (e.g.
      <span class="Pa">/usr/bin/kate</span>) or the name of an executable in the
      path (e.g. <span class="Pa">kate</span>). The editor must not run in the
      background, or else <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> won't be able to
      determine when it has exited. Some editors fork into the background by
      default, but can be told to stay in the foreground instead with a flag
      such as <var class="Ar">--nofork</var>.</li>
  <li>Run-time game patching: <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> has some built-in
      patches to fix bugs in games, but if new patches are needed, they can also
      be added via the configuration file, meaning you do not have to wait for a
      new <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> release in order to provide a patch.
      The syntax is as follows:
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
    <pre>patch = 0xd3d4 3 [0x31, 0x0c, 0x73] [0x51, 0x73, 0x0c]</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">This indicates that 3 bytes at address 0xd3d4 are being
        replaced. The first bracketed set of bytes indicates the expected
        existing bytes, and the second bracketed set of bytes indicates the
        replacement bytes. The replacement set must be the same size as the
        existing set. Such patches should be included only in a specific game's
        group; otherwise they will be applied to all games, which is generally a
        bad idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Fine-grained control over colors in Gargoyle; this does not apply to any
      other build types.
    <p class="Pp">At the most basic, there are 8 colors that the Z-machine can
        use, corresponding to ANSI colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
        magenta, cyan, and white. The syntax for setting these is:</p>
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
    <pre>color_red = 0xc23621</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">The color is specified as a 24-bit RGB value, 8 bits per
        color. The above is thus 0xc2 red, 0x36 green, and 0x21 blue. The value
        must be specified in hexadecimal, with an optional leading 0x.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="STYLES"><a class="permalink" href="#STYLES">STYLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Z-machine allows for different text styles to be selected:
    these are emphasized (typically italicized or underlined), bold, and reverse
    video. In addition, a fixed-width font can be selected. Glk does not
    guarantee the appearance of styles; it only allows you to select from a list
    of uses, rather than appearances. The following Glk styles are how
    <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> maps the Z-machine's text styles:</p>
<p class="Pp">Italic (or emphasized) uses the Emphasized style. Bold uses the
    Subheader style. Reverse video uses the Alert style. Fixed-width uses the
    Preformatted style.</p>
<p class="Pp">These were chosen because they map appropriately in the glktermw
    Glk implementation. If your Glk implementation does not render these styles
    in a manner you like, consult its documentation to see if it is possible to
    change the appearance of the various Glk styles.</p>
<p class="Pp">Gargoyle, although a Glk implementation, does not have these
    issues. The combination of styles is possible, and the appearance of styles
    can be guaranteed.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CHARACTER_GRAPHICS_FONT"><a class="permalink" href="#CHARACTER_GRAPHICS_FONT">CHARACTER
  GRAPHICS FONT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> can make use of a character graphics
    font. This font is used for drawing the interactive map, arrows, and runes.
    Most of the runes and arrows have Unicode equivalents and can be displayed
    if you have a font that contains these characters. Unicode also includes
    box-drawing characters which can be used to approximate the map in
    <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i>. These are not perfect, but they are not
    terrible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-g</code> option disables the character
    graphics font, but unfortunately the ability to tell a game that a
    particular font is unavailable postdates Infocom, so this flag will not
    prevent <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> from trying to use it. Instead,
    <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> makes use of the interpreter number (see
    <code class="Fl">-n</code>) to decide whether to use character graphics. If
    you are using a font that does not provide the necessary Unicode characters,
    you will want to run <i class="Em">Beyond Zork</i> without the character
    graphics font. This is easily accomplished by answering &#x201C;No&#x201D;
    when the game asks you if you are using a VT-220 (this only happens when the
    interpreter number is set to 1, which is the default).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the character font is disabled with <code class="Fl">-g</code>
    and a game tries to use it anyway (as is the case with <i class="Em">Beyond
    Zork</i>), the output will appear garbled, but only for that font. Anything
    the game prints out in a normal font will look fine.</p>
<p class="Pp">See section 16 of the <i class="Em">Z-Machine Standards
    Document</i> 1.1 for more information.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="META_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#META_COMMANDS">META
  COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">bocfel</code> includes support for &#x201C;meta
    commands&#x201D;, which are commands interpreted by
    <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> itself instead of the game. These are

    They are as follows, and are case sensitive:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="/undo"><a class="permalink" href="#/undo"><b class="Sy">/undo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Undo a turn. This is similar to the UNDO command some games provide, but

      confused with one saved by <b class="Sy">/save</b>, and vice versa.
    <p class="Pp">Because it creates non-standard save files, this command
        should be avoided unless it is absoulutely necessary, e.g. if the game

<h1 class="Sh" id="SOUND_EFFECTS"><a class="permalink" href="#SOUND_EFFECTS">SOUND
  EFFECTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Sound effects are supported under Glk, assuming the Glk library
    supports sound. The sound effects should be bundled in a Blorb file. If the
    story file itself is stored in a Blorb file, that file is used to find the
    sound effects. Otherwise, a separate Blorb file must exist and be named as
    follows: if the story file is <span class="Pa">/foo/bar/sherlock.z5</span>,
    then the Blorb file must be
  <span class="Pa">/foo/bar/sherlock.blb</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bleeps (sound effects 1 and 2) are supported under sufficiently
    modern Gargoyle releases.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CHEATING"><a class="permalink" href="#CHEATING">CHEATING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There is extremely rudimentary support for
    &#x201C;cheating&#x201D;. <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> is able to freeze
    certain areas of memory so that they always report the same value. The idea
    behind this is to prevent hunger and thirst counters from forcing you to eat
    and drink.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cheating is available through the configuration file as well as
    through meta debug commands (see
    <a class="Sx" href="#META_DEBUG_COMMANDS">META DEBUG COMMANDS</a> for
    information on using meta debug commands to cheat).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the configuration file is used, cheats are treated like any
    other configuration variable. The syntax is as follows:
    freeze:<b class="Sy">address</b>:<b class="Sy">value</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This causes the word (an unsigned 16-bit value) at address
    <b class="Sy">address</b> to always contain the value
    <b class="Sy">value</b>; <b class="Sy">value</b> can be decimal,
    hexadecimal, or octal, with a leading <b class="Sy">0x</b> signifying
    hexadecimal and a leading <b class="Sy">0</b> signifying octal.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>cheat = freeze:0xabcd:0
cheat = freeze:G00:0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Visit
    <a class="Lk" href="http://bocfel.org/cheats/">http://bocfel.org/cheats/</a>
    for a list of a few cheats for some Infocom games. More cheats are
    potentially discoverable using meta debug commands (see the
    <a class="Sx" href="#META_DEBUG_COMMANDS">META DEBUG COMMANDS</a> section).
    A more detailed explanation of how to figure out cheats is beyond the scope
    of this document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that it is possible for <code class="Nm">bocfel</code>
    to be built without support for cheating, in which case these cheats will
    silently do nothing. The <code class="Fl">-v</code> option can be used to
    determine whether this is the case.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AUXILIARY_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#AUXILIARY_FILES">AUXILIARY
  FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Z-machine provides the ability for games to load and save
    files on the host system (see section 7.6 of version 1.1 of the Z-machine
    Standards Document). <code class="Nm">bocfel</code> confines these files to
    game-specific directories so that games are unable to overwrite arbitrary
    files on the host system. The game-specific directories are places in
    platform-specific locations. On Unix, this directory is
    <span class="Pa">$XDG_DATA_HOME/bocfel/auxiliary</span>. On Windows, it is
    <span class="Pa">%APPDATA%/Bocfel/auxiliary</span>. The individual game
    directories are the game IDs as reported by the <code class="Fl">-i</code>
    option.</p>
